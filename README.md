# Asynchronous code, and APIs

In this class you will be building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for data from a third-party API.

## Resources

Axios on NPM

Location IQ Geocoding API - Specifically, the “Search / Forward GeoCoding” and “Static Maps” sections.

## Process

For every lab in this module, you will have a new partner. For this lab, you and your new partner(s) will spend the first 15 minutes planning out an approach to this lab’s work on a whiteboard.

1. Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 15 minutes).
    1. Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
    2. Outline the functions that support this data flow.
    3. Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.

You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

## Workflow

- We will be using the Trello project management tool for the duration of this project.

- To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the Sign Up button.

- After creating an account, go to the City Explorer Trello Board, open the “… Show Menu” link, click the “… More” link, and then click “Copy Board”. Before you create it, be sure to “Change” from Private to “Public” (and click “Yes, Make Board Public”) so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click “Create” to add a copy to your personal account.

- This Trello board contains all of the features required to complete this lab assignment.

- Review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.

- Within each story, note the acceptance criteria (“Given … When … Then…”) and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.

- Throughout the lab time, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.

## Documentation

Your README.md must include:

# Project Name

**Author**: Hayden Cooper
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Making a react project that involves making requests to a third-party API using the Axios library. The project involves working with a partner for the initial planning stages and then working independently to implement the plan. The Trello project management tool will be used to track progress and complete the required features, which are listed as user stories with acceptance criteria and checklists of feature tasks. The Location IQ Geocoding API is specifically mentioned as the API to be used. The text emphasizes the importance of carefully executing tasks in order, as they are often dependencies of one another.
## Getting Started
Get there keys and determine the flow of data and the lay out of the website.

## Architecture
React, Bootstrap, LocationIQ, Trello, and Axios.

## Change Log
04-17-23- 7:27PM EST (Readme update and merge to main for lab 06 completion)

04-18-23-3:00PM EST (Began building out the server back end of weather json for use as a API)

04-18-23-7:00PM EST (Working back end accoridng to instructor for the APIA/JSON mixed back end server)

## Credit and Collaborations

Instructor: JB Tellez Aubrey Patterson

## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

Estimate of time needed to complete: Back-end: 2 Hours/ Front-end: 3 Hours

Start time: Back end- 3:00PM EST-7:PM EST / Front end- 10:00PM EST- 12:30AM EST 

Finish time: Not done 404 error form who knows where anymore...beyond lost????

Actual time needed to complete: not done no clue where to go next been on a rabbit hole search for about 30- 45 minutes.

Add this information to your README.

## Submission Instructions

1. Complete your Feature Tasks for the lab, according to the Trello cards.
2. Create a PR back to the main branch of your repository, showing ALL your work, and merge it cleanly.
3. On Canvas, submit a link to your PR. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A link to the deployed version of your latest code.
    - A link to your public Trello board.
    - A question within the context of this lab assignment.
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
    - How long you spent working on this assignment.
