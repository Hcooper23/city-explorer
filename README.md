# Custom Servers with Node and Express

## Overview

In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.

## Process

For every lab in this module, you will have a new partner. You and your new partner(s) will spend the first 30 minutes reviewing each other’s code from the previous lab and planning out an approach to this lab’s work on a whiteboard.

1. Do a formal code review of each person’s code (10 minutes each).
    1. Open your partner’s GitHub pull request on your laptop.
    2. Identify an area in the code that:
        1. You don’t understand
        2. or seems overly complex
        3. or you see a way to improve
        4. or you want more information on
        5. or you really like or think is interesting
3. Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.

2. Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 10 minutes).
    1. Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
    2. Outline the functions that support this data flow.
    3. Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.

You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

## Workflow

- We will be using the Trello project management tool for the duration of this project.
- To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the Sign Up button.
- After creating an account, go to the City Explorer Trello Board, open the “… Show Menu” link, click the “… More” link, and then click “Copy Board”. Before you create it, be sure to “Change” from Private to “Public” (and click “Yes, Make Board Public”) so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click “Create” to add a copy to your personal account.
- This Trello board contains all of the features required to complete this lab assignment.
- Review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.
- Within each story, note the acceptance criteria (“Given … When … Then…”) and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.
- Throughout the lab time, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.

## Documentation

You must have a complete README.md for both your server and your website repositories.

Your README.md must include:

# Project Name

**Author**: Hayden Cooper
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Making a react project that involves making requests to a third-party API using the Axios library. The project involves working with a partner for the initial planning stages and then working independently to implement the plan. The Trello project management tool will be used to track progress and complete the required features, which are listed as user stories with acceptance criteria and checklists of feature tasks. The Location IQ Geocoding API is specifically mentioned as the API to be used. The text emphasizes the importance of carefully executing tasks in order, as they are often dependencies of one another.
## Getting Started
Get there keys and determine the flow of data and the lay out of the website.

## Architecture
React, Bootstrap, Trello, Axios, API'S (WeatherBit, MoviesDB, and Location IQ)

## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

Estimate of time needed to complete: Back-end: 2 Hours/ Front-end: 3 Hours

Start time: Back end- 3:00PM EST-5:00PM EST / Front end- 5:00PM EST- 9:30AM EST 

Finish time: Done I believe instructions kinda confusing 

Actual time needed to complete: Total of 6 Hours and 30 minutes

Add this information to your README.

## Submission Instructions

1. Complete your Feature Tasks for the lab, according to the Trello cards.
2. Your lab will require 2 repositories: 1 for the Server (back-end) and 1 for the client (front-end)
3. Create a PR back to the main branch of each of your repositories, showing ALL your work, and merge them cleanly.
4. On Canvas, submit a link to both PRs. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A link to the deployed version of your latest code.
    - A link to your public Trello board.
    - A question within the context of this lab assignment.
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
    - How long you spent working on this assignment.
